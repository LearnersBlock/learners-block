# Contributing to Learner's Block

We welcome contributions, they are what keep the Block alive! 

## Bug reporting

For bug reports, please search existing issues before posting a ticket.

If the bug relates to language translation, please see the Translation section of the README.md to see if you can resolve this issue yourself. Please note, that changes will not be instant, they will be included during the next deployment to the fleet. 

## Submitting pull requests

For pull requests we suggest discussing the changes through a ticket first. This is for your own sake in case there are already changes ongoing that will affect your contribution. If you are looking to contribute without a specific feature or goal in mind, please check the list of Good First Issues.

## Non-code related issues

If you would like to discuss other component of the Learner's Block community, or contributing in other ways, please reach out to us through the contact from on http://learnersblock.org/contact.
