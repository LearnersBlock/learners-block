# Development

## Backend

The backend for this site is served by [Strapi](https://strapi.io). Please see the [template repository](https://github.com/LearnersBlock/library-backend-template) for details on building a development backend. 

## Install the dependencies
`yarn install`

### Start the app in development mode.
The code will build for use on the Learner's Block when the `ONDEVICE=TRUE` variable exists in the build environment. If the variable is missing, it will start in web mode for library.learnersblock.org.

`quasar dev`

### Lint the files
yarn run lint

### Build the app for production
The code will build for use on the Learner's Block when the `ONDEVICE=TRUE` variable exists in the build environment. If the variable is missing, it will start in web mode for library.learnersblock.org.

`quasar build`

### Customize the configuration
See [configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).

## Add Languages
To add languages for i18n, go src/layouts/MainLayout, add the language to const languages and name it. Then go to src/i18n and mimic all the files and content from en-US folder. Then go to src/i18n/index.ts and add the import to the file created there.
